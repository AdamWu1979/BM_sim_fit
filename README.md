# BM_sim_fit
Bloch-McConnell simulation (full numerical)

Allows for simulation of BM system upon RF presaturation 
 - multiple pools possible (water, 5 CEST, 1  semisolid MT)
 - trains RF pulses with arbitratry pulse shapes possible (gauss, sinc, spin-lock already implemented)
 - both analytical (if possible) and full numerical simulation possible
 - transient and steady-state possible
 - first order readout schemes possible
 - Both full Z-spectra and single offset evaluation possible
 - Ready for multi parameter simulations
